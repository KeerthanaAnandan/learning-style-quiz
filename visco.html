      Visual learners learn best when information is presented in a written
      language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams.
      If you are a visual learner, the suggestions that follow can help you to
      succeed in school to the best of your ability. Create graphic organizers
      such as diagrams and concept maps that use visual symbols to represent
      ideas and information. When trying to remember information, close your
      eyes and visualize the information. Include illustrations as you take
      notes in class. Use highlighter pens of contrasting colors to color code
      different aspects of the information in your textbooks. Sit in the front
      of the class so that you can clearly see the teacher. This will allow you
      to pick up facial expressions and body language that provide cues that
      what your teacher is saying is important to write in your notes. Take our

      Study in a place that is free from visual distractions. When using
      flashcards, limit the amount of information on a card so that you can form
      a mental picture of the information. Watch videos about topics you are
      studying in class. When hearing a new word you want to remember, visualize
      its spelling. When reviewing information, rewrite or draw the information
      from memory. When taking notes, replace words with symbols wherever
      possible. Type your written notes from class using different fonts, bold
      print, and underlining to make the most important concepts and facts
      visually apparent. When solving math problems that involve a sequence of
      steps, draw a series of boxes, each containing the appropriate piece of
      information in sequence. Try these suggestions and learn which ones work
      best for you.
