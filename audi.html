      Auditory learners learn best when information is presented in a spoken
      language format. If you are an auditory learner, the suggestions that
      follow can help you to succeed in school to the best of your ability.

      out. If allowed by your teacher, use a recording device to record class
      sessions. Use the recordings to support your written notes. Use a
      recording device to record important information from your textbooks so
      that you can listen to the information as frequently as needed. Work out
      math problems aloud, explaining to yourself the steps you are doing.
      Repeat facts and definitions of words over and over to yourself with your
      eyes closed. Create musical jingles or songs to remember information.
      Dictate assigned papers and type them later. Participate in class
      discussions as much as possible. Look for books on tape or other audio
      materials when learning about a subject. Be certain that your study place
      is free of auditory distractions. When you encounter new words while
      reading, sound them out syllable by syllable. Sit in front of the class to
      minimize things that might distract you from what your teacher is saying.

      ones work best for you.
